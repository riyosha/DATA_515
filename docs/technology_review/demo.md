"This film: a historical embarrassment, offensively sweet, and a masterclass in emotional manipulation.  It's Holocaust kitsch, twisting reality for cheap tears while disrespecting victims.  Apparently, the saddest part is the German kid, not, you know, the six million others. The ending?  Traumatic, haunting, unforgettable, and suffocating. Vera Farmiga's scream single-handedly revolutionized cinema, while the rest of the movie is apparently as historically accurate as Peter Pan.  If you haven't taken a history class, you might actually enjoy this melodrama, but prepare for an ending that will rip your mind open.  For everyone else, expect boredom,  false equivalence, and the overwhelming urge to throw up."
